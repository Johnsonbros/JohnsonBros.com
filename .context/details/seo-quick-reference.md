## Interpreting Rankings

### Position Scale

| Position | Assessment | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1-3 | Excellent | Maintain, potentially promote |
| 4-10 | Good | Optimize moderately |
| 11-20 | Fair | Needs improvement, create content |
| 21-50 | Poor | Significant optimization needed |
| 50+ | Not ranking | May need complete page revision |
| Not tracked | Not indexed | May need to be added to sitemap |

---

### Position Interpretation Notes

- **GSC shows "average position"** - This varies by user location, device, search history
- **Fluctuations are normal** - 1-3 position shifts aren't concerning
- **Look at trends** - Focus on 30-day trends, not daily changes
- **Context matters** - Rank #8 might be great if all competitors are ranked 1-7
- **Traffic > Ranking** - A rank #10 keyword that converts is better than rank #3 that doesn't

---

## Content Optimization Quick Tips

### If Keyword Is Not Ranking

**Step 1: Check Indexation**
```
site:johnsonbros.com/[town]
```
If no results: Add internal links from homepage, resubmit to GSC

**Step 2: Analyze Top 3 Competitors**
- Search the keyword in Google
- Review top 3 pages for:
  - Word count
  - Headers and structure
  - Unique angles
  - Visual elements

**Step 3: Optimize Your Page**
- Add unique town-specific content
- Include local details (neighborhoods, service areas)
- Add customer testimonials from that town
- Ensure keyword in H1, meta description, first 100 words

**Step 4: Build Backlinks**
- Get listed on Yelp, Google Business, BBB
- Reach out to local directories
- Contact local business associations

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Not seeing GSC data
- **Solution:** Give GSC 3-5 days to collect data; make sure domain is verified

### Problem: Rank tracking tool shows different positions than GSC
- **Solution:** Normal! Different tools use different methods. Trust GSC as primary source.

### Problem: Keywords aren't ranking after 2 weeks
- **Solution:** Normal! New pages take 4-8 weeks to appear. Check if page is indexed.

### Problem: Rankings dropped suddenly
- **Solution:** Check GSC for errors; review if competitors made major updates; wait 2-4 weeks for stability

### Problem: Team isn't updating tracking spreadsheet
- **Solution:** Set automatic reminder; consider automating data collection; assign clear owner
