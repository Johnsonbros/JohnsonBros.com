## Best Practices

### 1. Data Collection & Accuracy

**Do's:**
- ✅ Use Google Search Console as primary source of truth
- ✅ Collect data at consistent times (same day/time weekly)
- ✅ Track multiple tools for cross-validation
- ✅ Document data source for each metric
- ✅ Account for fluctuations (rankings vary by location, device)

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Don't panic over single-day fluctuations
- ❌ Don't mix data from different sources without noting
- ❌ Don't track "position" from a single Google search (not reliable)
- ❌ Don't ignore seasonal variations (holidays, weather changes)

---

### 2. Keyword Focus Areas

**Prioritize tracking in this order:**

1. **Tier 1 - Emergency Keywords** (Highest value)
   - "emergency plumber [town]"
   - Reason: High urgency, high conversion rate
   - Target: Get these to #1-3

2. **Tier 2 - Local Service Keywords** (High value)
   - "[town] plumber"
   - "[town] plumbing"
   - Reason: High search volume, direct intent
   - Target: Get to #1-5

3. **Tier 3 - Specialized Service Keywords** (Medium value)
   - "[town] drain cleaning"
   - Reason: Secondary service opportunity
   - Target: Get to #1-10

4. **Tier 4 - Location-Based Keywords** (Emerging)
   - "plumber near [town] MA"
   - Reason: Mobile and location-aware searches
   - Target: Develop long-term

---

### 3. Ranking Position Interpretation

**Google Search Console Note:**
- GSC reports "average position" not exact position
- Position varies by:
  - User location
  - User search history
  - Device type (mobile vs. desktop)
  - Time of day
  - Other rank-tracking tools may differ

**Interpretation Guide:**
- **Position 1-3:** Excellent, capturing most clicks
- **Position 4-10:** Good, room for improvement
- **Position 11-20:** Visible but below-the-fold, needs work
- **Position 21+:** Not ranking well, requires content changes

---

### 4. Content Optimization for Rankings

**When a keyword isn't ranking:**

1. **Check if page is indexed**
   ```
   site:johnsonbros.com/[town]
   ```
   If not indexed, add internal links and submit to GSC

2. **Analyze competitor content**
   - Search keyword in Google
   - Review top 3 ranking pages
   - Note: word count, headers, unique elements
   - Identify gaps in your content

3. **Optimize page content**
   - Include keyword in H1, meta description
   - Add local details (address, service areas, neighborhoods)
   - Include customer testimonials from town
   - Add FAQs specific to town
   - Internal link from homepage and nearby town pages

4. **Build backlinks**
   - Get listed on local directories
   - Reach out for local business associations
   - Partner with complementary businesses

---

### 5. Avoiding Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Expecting Immediate Results**
- ✅ Realistic: First 8-12 weeks to see movement
- ✅ Realistic: 3-6 months for major improvements
- ❌ Wrong: Ranking changes overnight

**Pitfall 2: Over-Optimizing**
- ✅ Realistic: 2-3% keyword density natural
- ✅ Realistic: Keyword in title, H1, and 2-3x in body
- ❌ Wrong: Stuffing keyword excessively ("keyword|keyword|keyword")

**Pitfall 3: Ignoring User Experience**
- ✅ Do: Make pages mobile-friendly, fast-loading
- ✅ Do: Make content readable and valuable
- ❌ Don't: Sacrifice UX for keywords

**Pitfall 4: Forgetting Basics**
- ✅ Do: Ensure pages have quality backlinks
- ✅ Do: Update pages regularly
- ✅ Do: Monitor technical SEO
- ❌ Don't: Assume keyword optimization alone is enough

## Questions & Support

### Common Questions

A: Start with free tools (GSC, GA4). Upgrade to SE Ranking ($29/mo) after 30 days to get more features.

**Q: Why are some keywords not ranking at all?**
A: Page may not be indexed, or content doesn't match search intent. Check GSC coverage reports and optimize content.

A: Compare organic traffic and leads month-over-month. After 90 days, should see 20-50% improvement.

**Q: Can we rank #1 for all keywords?**
