## NAP Consistency Checklist (Do This First)

**CRITICAL**: Before submitting to ANY directory, lock down your canonical NAP. Inconsistency hurts rankings.

### Canonical Business Information

| Field | Location 1 (Primary) | Location 2 |
|-------|---------------------|------------|
| **Business Name** | Johnson Bros. Plumbing & Drain Cleaning | Johnson Bros. Plumbing & Drain Cleaning |
| **Address** | [Your Quincy Address] | [Your Abington Address] |
| **Phone** | (617) 479-9911 | [Secondary Phone or Same] |
| **Website** | https://johnsonbros.com | https://johnsonbros.com |
| **Hours** | 24/7 Emergency, M-F 8-5 Regular | Same |

### NAP Rules

1. **Name**: Use the EXACT same business name everywhere
2. **Address**: Use consistent formatting (St vs Street). Match USPS format.
3. **Phone**: Use same format everywhere: (617) 479-9911
4. **Secondary Location**: List as separate location on directories that support multi-location
