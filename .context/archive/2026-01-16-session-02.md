## In Progress at Session End

Nothing actively in progress. Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2.

---

## Key Decisions

1. **Docker for PostgreSQL**: Used Docker to isolate database, mapped to port 5433 to avoid conflicts
2. **Degraded mode accepted**: Running without API keys is acceptable for local development
3. **Comprehensive .gitignore**: Expanded to prevent accidental commit of secrets, logs, caches

## Blockers/Dependencies

None. System was fully operational in degraded mode.

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `.env` | Created | DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET |
| `.gitignore` | Modified | 6 -> 140 lines |
| `.context/` | Created | Beacon system initialized |

## Next Session Recommendations

1. Verify environment works on new machine
2. Start Phase 2: Feature Verification
3. Test features that work without API keys:
   - Blog system
   - Admin panel access
   - Static pages
   - Form rendering
4. Consider adding API keys for full functionality
