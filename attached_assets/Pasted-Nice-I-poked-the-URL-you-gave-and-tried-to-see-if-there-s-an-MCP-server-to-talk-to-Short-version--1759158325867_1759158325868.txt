Nice — I poked the URL you gave and tried to see if there’s an MCP server to talk to. Short version up front: I couldn’t find or parse a visible MCP manifest / server from that deployment page, but that could be because the Replit site is a dynamic app (or the MCP endpoints live on a different subdomain / API host). I ran a few automated checks and also pulled MCP docs so you and I can follow a concrete playbook. Here’s what I did and what to try next.

What I tried

* I opened the URL you sent: `https://the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app`. (attempted load). ([the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app][1])
* I searched for common MCP indicators (manifests, “mcp”, “manifest.json”, WebSocket/SSE hints) but the page content the browser returned didn’t reveal an obvious MCP manifest or public MCP endpoints. (dynamic sites sometimes hide API hosts behind JS or on other domains). ([the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app][1])

Why that isn’t a smoking-gun

* MCP servers typically advertise a machine-readable manifest at a well-known path (e.g. `/.well-known/mcp/manifest.json` or similar discovery endpoints). MCP discovery and authorization behavior is documented in the MCP spec and community guides. If the manifest isn’t publicly reachable at `https://<host>/.well-known/...` or the API host differs from the public web host, automatic detection will fail. ([Medium][2])

If you want to check it right now from a terminal (fast, reproducible checks)
Run these commands (one at a time) on the server or from a machine that can reach the site — they’ll tell us if a public MCP manifest exists and where the API host is:

1. Try manifest discovery:

```bash
curl -i https://the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app/.well-known/mcp/manifest.json
curl -i https://the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app/.well-known/mcp.json
curl -i https://the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app/.well-known/mcp/manifest
```

If one returns 200 and JSON, paste that JSON here and I’ll parse the tools and transports.

2. If manifest isn’t at the public host, try the common API root (sometimes Replit projects expose an `api.` or different path):

```bash
curl -I https://api.the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app/.well-known/mcp/manifest.json
curl -I https://the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
```

3. If a manifest lists an SSE (Server-Sent Events) or websocket transport, you can open a connection and watch the handshake with `websocat` or `curl -N`. Example (replace `<SSE_URL>` with the manifest transport URL):

```bash
# SSE (server-sent events)
curl -N "<SSE_URL>"

# WebSocket (use websocat to test)
websocat "<WS_URL>"
```

4. If you’d rather test via an MCP client library, there are MCP SDKs and CLI tools (or you can use simple Node/Python examples). The MCP docs show how clients discover manifests and authorize. ([Model Context Protocol][3])

How I can help next (pick one)

* If you paste the `/.well-known/mcp/manifest.json` (or the full JSON), I’ll parse it and list the exposed tools and an example message exchange to interact with each tool.
* If you want me to try other hosts/subdomains for you, give me the API host (for example `api.the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app`) and I’ll run the same discovery steps.
* If you’d prefer to run the curl checks yourself, paste the output here and I’ll take it from there.

Why this approach is safe and sensible

* MCP discovery uses `/.well-known/...` metadata and well-known authorization flows; that’s the protocol-standard place to look. If the manifest isn’t public (or is behind auth), discovery will fail until we either have credentials or the team exposes a discovery URL. Docs and guides on MCP discovery/authorization are here if you want to dive deeper. ([Model Context Protocol][4])

One question (just one — so we keep things crisp): do you want me to try discovery on other likely hosts/subdomains (e.g., `api.the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app` or `the-johnson-broscom-aisyncservice.replit.app/api`) right now, or would you prefer to run the `curl` commands above and paste any responses here?
