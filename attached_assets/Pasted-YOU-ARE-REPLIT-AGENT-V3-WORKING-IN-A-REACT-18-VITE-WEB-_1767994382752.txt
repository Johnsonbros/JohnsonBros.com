YOU ARE REPLIT AGENT V3 WORKING IN A REACT 18 + VITE WEB APP.

GOAL
Update our Sentry browser initialization so it supports:
1) Current environments: Vite dev on localhost, Replit dev URL, Replit production URL
2) Future production domain: https://www.thejohnsonbros.com (and optionally https://thejohnsonbros.com)
3) Correct distributed tracing: tracePropagationTargets must include all of the above so tracing headers propagate to our API calls
4) Safety: do NOT widen targets too much (no “match anything” regex). Keep it scoped to our known hosts.

CONTEXT
We currently have a Sentry.init wrapper with:
- guard: if initialized or !config.enabled return
- integrations: browserTracingIntegration() + captureConsoleIntegration({ levels: ['error','warn'] })
- beforeSend scrubs sensitive headers/cookies
- dev mode drops events unless VITE_SENTRY_DEBUG is true
Right now tracePropagationTargets includes localhost, a regex for *.johnsonbrosplumbing.com (WRONG DOMAIN), and /^\// for relative paths.

REQUIREMENTS
A) Replace the johnsonbrosplumbing.com regex with the correct domain(s) for TheJohnsonBros:
   - Allow https://www.thejohnsonbros.com
   - Allow https://thejohnsonbros.com
   - Allow any subdomain under thejohnsonbros.com (e.g. api.thejohnsonbros.com, mcp.thejohnsonbros.com) BUT ONLY under that domain

B) Add support for Replit hosts (dev + prod):
   - Detect current runtime origin via window.location.hostname
   - Allow tracing to same-host requests automatically
   - Optionally allow additional API host via env var (recommended)

C) Make tracePropagationTargets environment-driven:
   - Add VITE_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN (e.g. thejohnsonbros.com)
   - Add VITE_API_ORIGIN (optional full origin like https://api.thejohnsonbros.com or Replit URL)
   - Implement a function buildTracePropagationTargets() that returns an array of:
     - 'localhost'
     - window.location.hostname (as string)
     - /^\// (for relative)
     - regex for *.thejohnsonbros.com (and root domain)
     - if VITE_API_ORIGIN exists, include it (string or regex matching it)

D) Keep security tight:
   - Do NOT include broad patterns like /^https:\/\//
   - Do NOT include “.*” catch-alls
   - Keep beforeSend scrubbing as-is or improve it (but do not remove it)

E) Output:
   1) Make the code change in the Sentry initialization file (where initialize() lives)
   2) Add/update .env.example to document:
      - VITE_SENTRY_DSN
      - VITE_SENTRY_DEBUG
      - VITE_PUBLIC_APP_DOMAIN=thejohnsonbros.com
      - VITE_API_ORIGIN= (optional)
   3) Add a tiny dev note in README or a comment explaining how to set these on Replit

VALIDATION / TESTS (DO THESE)
- Console.log the computed tracePropagationTargets in dev ONLY when VITE_SENTRY_DEBUG is enabled
- Verify the app builds
- Ensure tracing headers propagate to fetch/XHR requests to:
  - relative /api routes
  - same-origin calls
  - configured VITE_API_ORIGIN calls
- Ensure events are dropped in development unless VITE_SENTRY_DEBUG is set

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Use import.meta.env for Vite env vars
- When building regex for thejohnsonbros.com:
  - include both root and subdomains
  - constrain to https and the domain
- Prefer small, readable helpers over clever one-liners.

DELIVERABLE
Commit-ready code changes with clear diffs and no broken imports.
