### Why it works

Quick checkins from every job give you local search value for every city and neighborhood, keyword value for everything you do, and a relevant media photo or video rankings boost.

Great customer reviews at a 40% clip prove to prospects that you've delighted people near them, building a better-and-better overall reputation and a local reputation in the places that matter to you most.

All the checkins, photos, videos, and reviews boost your Google Maps placement. Expand and improve your organic local search rankings for your own site. And drive more traffic and leads straight to your own website.

When your local ranking and location Reputation Footprint goes from a single point, to your entire service area, the benefits are clear.
