## AI-generated Key Takeaways

outlined\_flag

- This page provides troubleshooting steps for Google Maps JavaScript API errors, focusing on billing and API key issues.

- Darkened or watermarked maps usually indicate problems with your API key or billing account.

- Ensure your billing account is enabled and your API key is valid to resolve common errors.

- Refer to the error code table for detailed descriptions and specific solutions.

- For most billing or key issues, solutions can be found within the Google Cloud console.


This page describes the error messages that can be returned by the
Maps JavaScript API. The Maps JavaScript API writes
error and warning messages to the JavaScript console. Certain error
conditions may also occur, which result in the display of a darkened
watermarked map.

## API Key and Billing Errors

### Troubleshooting

Under certain circumstances, a darkened map, or 'negative' Street View image, watermarked with the text "for development purposes only",
may be displayed. This behavior typically indicates issues with either an API key or billing. In order to use Google Maps Platform products,
billing must be enabled on your account, and all requests must include a valid API key. For help on finding error messages, see the section on
[checking errors in your browser](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#checking-errors).

The following flow will help you troubleshoot the issue.

#### Are you using an API key?

#### I'm not sure. How can I check if I am using an API key?

An API key is passed as the `key` parameter in the URL that is used to load the
Maps JavaScript API. Here are a few options to check if you are using an API key:

- Use the [Google Maps Platform API Checker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-maps-platform-api/mlikepnkghhlnkgeejmlkfeheihlehne) Chrome extension. This allows you to determine if your
website is properly implementing Google’s licensed Maps APIs.

- If you are using a library or plugin to load the Maps JavaScript API,
check the settings for that library and look for an API key option.
- Check [errors in your browser](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#checking-errors).
If you see the following messages, you are not using your API key correctly:
  - Google Maps JavaScript API warning:
     [NoApiKeys](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#no-api-keys)
  - Google Maps JavaScript API error:
     [MissingKeyMapError](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#missing-key-map-error)

#### For web developers:

- If you have access to the source code of your application, look for the
`<script>` tag which is used to load the Maps JavaScript API.
When loading the Maps JavaScript API, substitute `YOUR_API_KEY`
in the code below with your API key.




```
    <script async defer
      src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap">
    </script>
```

- Check the network traffic generated by your website in the browser.
In Chrome, this can be viewed using the
[DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) **Network** tab.
Here you will see the network requests made by your website. Requests made using the
Maps JavaScript API will be under the path `maps/api/js`.
Here you can confirm if the requests are using the `key` parameter.
It may be helpful to [filter your network traffic](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console#filtering_the_console_output) by `maps/api/js` when viewing the **Network** tab.


#### No, I am not using an API key.

To get an API key, click the button below. If you do not see a guided setup, follow the
full instructions at [Get Started with Google Maps\\
Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started#procedures).


[Get Started](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started)

#### Yes, I am using an API key.

Great! Let’s move on and check if a billing account is attached to your project.

#### Is a billing account attached to your project?

#### I'm not sure. How can I check if billing account is attached to my project?

Go to the [Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing/enable?utm_source=Docs_BillingNudge) in the Google Cloud console and select the project under which your API key was created.
To confirm the key is associated with the project:

1. Go to the **Credentials** section, which can be accessed from the left side bar under
    **Google Maps Platform > Credentials**.
2. Check that the API key you currently use on your website is listed.
    If that's not the case, switch to a different project, and check the credentials there.
3. If you cannot locate the project for your API key, you may have lost access to this project.
    Ask others in your organization for help. If the original project cannot be located, you should:
1. Create a new project. This can be done by selecting **New Project**
       from the projects list, or by selecting **Create Project** via the
       [Resource Manager page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager).

2. Create a new API key. This can be done on the **Credentials** page.
       Once there click **Create credentials** and then select **API key**.

Once you have located your project in the Cloud console,
check if a billing account is attached by navigating to the [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing) section in the left side menu.


#### No, a billing account is not attached to my project.

Go to the [Enable Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing/enable?utm_source=Docs_BillingNudge) page in the Cloud console
and add a billing account to your project. For additional information, see
[Get Started with Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started).

#### Yes, a billing account is attached to my project.

Great! Let’s make sure the provided billing method is valid.

#### Is the provided billing method no longer valid (for example an expired credit card)?

You [can add, remove, or update a payment method](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/payment-methods) in the Cloud console.

#### Is there an exceeded self-imposed daily limit on the API?

If you have set a daily limit on any of your APIs, which is common to prevent unexpected increases,
you can resolve this by [increasing your daily limit](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#usage_cap).

You can check your daily limits by going to the
[APIs & Services Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/apiui/apis/enabled?utm_source=Docs_EnabledAPIsView) in the
Cloud console. Once there:

1. Select a project if prompted.
2. Select an API from the list, then click the **Quotas** tab.

#### Does your API key have an IP addresses restriction?

API keys with an **IP addresses** restriction can only be used with web services that are
intended for use from the server side (such as the
[Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)
and other [Web Service APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform)).
Most of these web services have equivalent services within the Maps JavaScript API (for example, see the
[Geocoding Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding)).
To use the Maps JavaScript API client side services, you will need to create a separate API key which
can be secured with an **HTTP referrers** restriction (see
[Get, add, and restrict an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started#api-key)).

## Checking Errors in Your Browser

The Maps JavaScript API writes error messages to
`window.console`. This section explains how you can check the
`window.console` output in Google Chrome. If you are using any other
browsers, please check the developer documentation for your browser. For your
reference, this is a list of tools to check `window.console` output
in some other browsers.

- [Web Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console) for Firefox.
- [Remote debugging](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging) for Android.
- [Web Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html) for iOS.

In Chrome, you can use the
[JavaScript Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/console)
to check `window.console` output as follows.

1. To open the Developer Tools, select the menu icon > More Tools >
    Developer Tools.

2. To open the JavaScript Console, press the ESC key on your keyboard.
    The ESC key will toggle the JavaScript Console. If you close the console,
    press the ESC key again to open it.


If any errors or warnings occurred when loading the
Maps JavaScript API, they appear as one or more lines in the
console.
An error or warning message has the following format:

`Google Maps API error: [ERROR CODE] [Link to API document]`

or

`Google Maps API warning: [ERROR CODE] [Link to API  document]`

You can check the [error codes table](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages#deverrorcode) above to find
the error code in the error message. You can also find the details about the
error message in the API document linked from the message.

**Note:** You can
[listen for authentication errors](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/events#auth-errors)
programmatically.

## Handling unsupported browsers

Ensure that the version of the browser you are using is
[currently supported by the\\
Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/browsersupport).

If you're developing a native Windows application that runs in a WebView, ensure that you are
using [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) based
on Edge. Previous versions of WebView, based on Internet Explorer, are no longer supported.

## If your code still isn't working

To help you get your maps code up and running, Brendan Kenny and Mano Marks point out
some common mistakes and how to fix them in this video.

- Look for typos. Remember that JavaScript is a case-sensitive
language.
- Check the basics - some of the most common problems occur with the
initial map creation. Such as:


  - Confirm that you've specified the `zoom`
     and `center` properties in your map
     options.
  - Ensure that you have declared a div element in which the map will
     appear on the screen.
  - Ensure that the div element for the map has a height. By default,
     div elements are created with a height of 0, and are therefore
     invisible.

Refer to our examples for a
[reference\\
implementation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple).

- Use a JavaScript debugger to help identify problems, like the one available
in the [Chrome\\
Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/javascript-debugging). Start by looking in the JavaScript console for errors.

- Post questions to [Stack\\
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=google-maps-api-3,google-maps). Guidelines on how to post great questions are available on
the [Support](https://developers.google.com/maps/support) page.
