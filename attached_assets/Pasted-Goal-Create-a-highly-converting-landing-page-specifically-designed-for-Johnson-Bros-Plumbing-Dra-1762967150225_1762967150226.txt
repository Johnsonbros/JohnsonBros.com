🖼 Brand & Tone Guidelines

Color palette:

Primary: Deep Blue and Bright Orange (our main brand colors).

Secondary: White and Silver for contrast and modern polish.

Accent: Red only sparingly for urgency (e.g., emergency call-outs or buttons).

Visual style:

Clean and professional, with subtle “cartoon‑realism” touches in illustrative elements.

Use high‑quality images that show happy families, friendly plumbers, vans, and modern equipment.

All imagery must reflect diversity (e.g., families of different backgrounds), and be consistent with Johnson Bros.’ customer‑centric brand.

Trustworthy, family‑oriented, and down‑to‑earth.

Highlight that we are family‑owned, fully licensed & insured, and serve the community “There when it matters most.”

Emphasize professionalism, reliability, and understanding of unique customer needs.

Typography:

Use modern, easy‑to‑read fonts (e.g., a bold sans-serif for headlines, a friendly serif or sans-serif for body text).

Ensure text contrasts well with backgrounds for accessibility.
